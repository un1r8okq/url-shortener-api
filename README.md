# URL Shortener

This project was created for me to learn Kotlin/Spring. Its sister project is [a React SPA](https://github.com/un1r8okq/url-shortener-ui).

## Getting started
    
1. Download the IntelliJ IDEA IDE
2. Install [the EnvFile plugin in IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile)
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, and set a value for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
4. Setup a run configuration with the main class as `land.ver.url.shortener.UrlShortenerApplicationKt` and with the `.env` file enabled
5. Run the application
6. Go setup and run [the UI project](https://github.com/un1r8okq/url-shortener-ui)
